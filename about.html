    <!--------ABOUT ME --------->
    <section class="flex-container fade-in-animation">
        <div class="left-container">
            <h1 >Based in NYC. <br>Highly curious human.</h1><br>
            <p>
              I'm a digital designer and frontend developer 
              driven by curiosity and creativity. I was born 
              and raised in Veracruz, Mexico, and moved to 
              the U.S. for college at the age of 17. I make 
              the most of my time by pursuing my passions, 
              which include learning about technology, cybersecurity, 
              graphic design, photography, reading, and bouldering. 
              I would describe myself as self-sufficient, resourceful, 
              a proactive team player, and ambitious.
