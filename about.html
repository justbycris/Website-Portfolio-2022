    <!--------ABOUT ME --------->

        <div class="left-container">
            <h1 >Based in NYC. <br>Highly curious human.</h1><br>
            <p>
                I'm digital designer and frontend developer driven by curiosity and creativity. I was born and raised in Veracruz, 
                Mexico but I've been living in the U.S. for the last 8 years. I make the most of my time by pursuing my passions 
                on tech, learning, photography, connecting with new people, reading, and recently bouldering! I would describe 
                myself as resourceful, self-efficient, a team player with initiative, and quite funny.
